PROTOTYPE SUBMISSION

Functionality of App Completed:
- User onboarding/account creation
- Profile page tab functionality mostly complete
  - Can add, edit, delete goals
  - Can edit profile
  - On deletion of user account, will be redirected back to onboarding
  
Changes to app proposal/Issues during coding:
- Setting up Core Data and the onboarding process took much longer than I accounted for, ended up spending a week and a half setting it up and am still not sure if the architecture of app is the best. May need to refactor later
- May decide to implement firebase authentication later, but found that implementing user settings soley in CoreData works fine. Additionally firebase and CoreData do not work well together
- Said that the Today Page Tab would completed this week, however I decided to implement the Profile Page instead
- Did not include in App Proposal resources part, but will be using https://github.com/AppPear/ChartViewDemo to generate line charts.
- Will need to use UIKit to take and/or upload photos to app
- Will also be using https://github.com/annthurium/affirmations (Affirmations API) as a resource for widgets on Today Page
